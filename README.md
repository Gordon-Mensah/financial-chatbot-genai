# 💬 Financial Chatbot — GenAI Simulation

This project showcases a conversational AI chatbot built during the **GenAI Job Simulation** with **BCG X** and **Forage**. The chatbot answers financial queries using real company data, offering insights into revenue, net income, assets, liabilities, and more — all through natural language interaction.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The chatbot is designed to:
- Respond to financial questions about **Microsoft**, **Tesla**, and **Apple**
- Handle queries from **2023 to 2025**
- Calculate metrics like **total revenue**, **net income**, and **cash flow**
- Explain financial terms in plain language
- Track conversation context and trends
- Respond with personality (Analyst, Intern, Nerd modes)

This prototype demonstrates how generative AI can enhance financial analysis and client interaction through intelligent automation.
